WHAT PROBLEM I SOLVED?
  An LP with spanning tree polytope. The difficult thing for solving
  this problem is that this LP has exponentially many constraints.
  Data size of all constraints may be even bigger than main memory capacity.
  If you want to see exact LP I solved, see Documentation/problem.txt

HOW I SOLVED THE PROBLEM?
 - C++ code using CPLEX
 - Delayed column generation
 - Primal simplex method
 - An Idea: (S, y) = (x*, 0) is a basic feasible solution
 If you want more detailed explanation, see Documentation/algorithm.txt

HOW TO RUN?
 1. Compilation
      make
 2. Run
      ./ss4

HOW TO MIGRATE THIS PROJECT INTO YOUR PROJECT?
  It is SO EASY:
    1. Install CPLEX - You have to know the path it is installed.
    2. Modify directory options in Makefile.
  Then compilation will work well
