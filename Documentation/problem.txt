Your program must read the description of the point from input.txt in the
current working directory, and output a convex combination to output.txt
in the current working directory.
The 1st line of input.txt contains the number of vertices n (< 1,000)
and the number of edges m (< 10,000), separated by a space.
Each vertex is numbered from 0 to n - 1. Each of the following m lines
of the input file contains (the numeric IDs of) the two endpoints
and the value on each edge, in that order, separated by a space.
The first line of the output file contains the number of spanning trees k
with nonzero coefficients. The next kn lines represent each of
those spanning trees: each k lines represent a spanning tree, of which
the first line contains the weight of the spanning tree, and the following
n - 1 lines show the two endpoints of each edge in the tree, separated
by a space. You can assume that the given input is always a point
in the spanning tree polytope.
